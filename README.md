# rnsg-qp-coeffs
Implementation of Algorithm 7.3 in A Sequence of Quasipolynomials Arising from Random Numerical Semigroups.

Formulas for h <subscript>n, d_n - k</subscript> for sufficiently large n and k = 5, 6, 7 given in the file qp_formulas.txt

Build with 

`g++ h.cpp -o h`

and run with

`./h n k`

for n sufficiently large with respect to k.
